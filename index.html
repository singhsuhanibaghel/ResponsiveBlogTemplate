            <h1>How is ISRO ahead of many other countries in achieving their goals with a much lesser budget than them?
            </h1>
            <p>In the grand theater of space exploration, where billions are spent reaching for the stars, there exists a silent champion that defies convention: the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Despite operating with a fraction of the budget of its counterparts, ISRO continues to rewrite the rules of cosmic conquest, achieving monumental feats that inspire awe and admiration worldwide. Let's delve into the secrets behind ISRO's stellar success on a shoestring budget.
            </p>
                <h3>Frugal Innovation: Beyond Jugaad</h3>
                <p>ISRO's innovation goes beyond just "jugaad" (a Hindi term for finding ingenious solutions with limited resources). They prioritize developing their own technologies, from powerful rocket engines like the cryogenic engine used in the GSLV Mk-III to sophisticated scientific instruments onboard their missions. This not only reduces dependence on foreign technology, but also fosters a culture of "we can do it ourselves." Imagine the team's pride when a homegrown innovation leads to a groundbreaking discovery!They focus are willing to take calculated risks
                </p>

                <h3>Efficient Project Management: Every Rupee Counts</h3>
                <p>ISRO's meticulous project management is legendary. They follow standardized processes that streamline every step, from mission planning to launch execution. This minimizes wastage and delays, ensuring every rupee is used effectively.  Think of it like a perfectly optimized spaceship – every component plays a vital role, maximizing efficiency and minimizing unnecessary resources.
                </p>

                <h3>Skilled Workforce: Growing Their Own Astronauts (Almost!)</h3>
                <p>ISRO understands the importance of a skilled workforce.  They invest heavily in nurturing talent through robust educational programs and in-house training. This dedicated team becomes a repository of knowledge,  saving costs compared to programs that rely on a large pool of foreign experts.  This focus on talent development also fuels a pipeline for the future, potentially leading the way for a future Indian human spaceflight program (Gaganyaan)!
                </p>
                
                <h3>Collaboration is Key: Sharing the Burden, Sharing the Success</h3>
                <p>Space exploration is a collaborative effort, and ISRO embraces this philosophy. They actively partner with universities and private industries. Universities provide cutting-edge research and a pool of bright minds, while private companies bring  specialized expertise and  potential co-investment opportunities. This  sharing of resources and knowledge allows ISRO to  undertake  more ambitious projects while minimizing the financial burden.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Government Support: A Force Multiplier</h3>
                <p>The Indian government plays a crucial role in ISRO's success. They recognize the importance of space exploration for national development and scientific advancement. This translates into  consistent  financial  backing and  political  support, allowing ISRO to focus on achieving their goals without  bureaucratic hurdles. This partnership is a force multiplier, propelling ISRO's  ambitions  forward.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Beyond Cost-Effectiveness: The Bigger Picture</h3>
                <p>While cost-effectiveness is a major advantage, it's important to acknowledge the trade-offs.  ISRO's missions might involve lighter payloads or less powerful rockets compared to those of space agencies with larger budgets. However, the scientific value of their missions remains undeniable.  Their success in  discovering  water on the Moon with Chandrayaan-1 and  reaching Mars orbit on their first attempt with Mangalyaan are testaments to their scientific prowess.
                </p>

                <h3>ISRO: An Inspiration for the Future</h3>
                <p>ISRO's story is an inspiration for space programs worldwide. It demonstrates that with  ingenuity,  collaboration, and  efficient resource management,  incredible feats can be achieved  even with a limited budget.  Their success paves the way for a future where space exploration is no longer the domain of just a few wealthy nations, but a collaborative endeavor for the betterment of humankind.

        <h1>Chandrayaan 2
        </h1>
        <p>Chandrayaan-2's success has filled 1.4 billion hearts with pride. Celebrations were held across India and overseas. On August 23, 2023, Chandrayaan-2 landed on the Moon's south polar region, making history as the first mission to do so. Isro's scientists are synonymous with excellence and diligence, highly innovative and professional, making everyone proud.
        </p>
        <h2>THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE SHATTERED DREAMS
        </h2>
        <p>Chandrayaan 2 was launched on July 22, 2019. I have watched numerous videos and read a lot about the mission, including its history, mechanics, and trajectory. It was a significant event for India, and the world as it is not an easy feat to reach the moon, as only three countries have been able to achieve it. India had a chance to become the fourth.

            Every time Chandrayaan 2 did something, it was reflected in foreign media. The world watched as India's lunar mission entered Earth's orbit, exited the orbit, and entered the lunar orbit, among other things. The whole country, including myself, was excited, while neighbouring countries were jealous. We were eagerly waiting for the day when Pragyan would walk out of Vikram and print the words ISRO and the image of the state emblem of India on the lunar soil. The day was 7th September 2019.
            
            I felt proud as an Indian while I eagerly checked for updates on Chandrayaan 2 and waited for the live telecast of Vikram's landing on the moon. Despite an earlier delay, the mission progressed successfully, and everyone was cheering for our nation's achievement. Although there was a minor setback when the trajectory deflected suddenly, our scientists at ISRO have worked tirelessly, and we are confident that they will analyze the problem and find a solution. We should remain optimistic and support our scientists and their continued efforts to make India a prominent figure in space exploration.
            
            Despite the lander not communicating yet, the Chandrayaan mission is still a success. We gave it our all, and while we may be disappointed, we should focus on the fact that we tried our best. As an Indian mission, we never lose hope. Let's be proud of what we accomplished and keep trying.
            I opened twitter and see a tweet by Shaadi.com which says, "You got more people united than us ISRO. Please teach us the tricks." I smiled and said in my mind, "Quite True!!".</p>

        <h1>Chandrayaan 3
        </h1>
        <p>India's Chandrayaan-3 mission, which successfully landed near the moon's south pole, was built and launched at a budget of $75 million, significantly lower than Russia's Luna-25 mission, which cost $200 million. The success highlights India's ability to conduct exploratory missions at a much lower cost, positioning the country as a player in the global space industry. Chandrayaan-3 took 40 days to reach the moon using less powerful rockets and the slingshot method, compared to Luna-25's 10-day journey with more powerful thrusters.
            In comparison, Russia’s Luna-25, which crashed while trying to reach the same area of the moon last week, took roughly $200 million to build and launch, making India’s programme notable for success despite requiring much lower spending. The mission itself, Isro officials said in the past and reiterated on Wednesday, was meant to demonstrate the Indian space agency’s aspirations of interplanetary travel and doing so at shoestring budgets unheard of in other countries. The difference between Luna-25 and Chandrayaan-3 illustrates how Isro saved costs. The Russian craft was strapped with a more powerful rocket at launch, and had more powerful thrusters to boost its journey from Earth to moon — features that allowed it to complete the (eventually unsuccessful) journey in 10 days
